👋 Hello I'm João Guedes - @FindingBits

🧑‍💻 Coding addict, programming my way up the ladder.
Still a newbie compared to some standards but I manage to learn the ropes and assure my best coding practices to every line that I write.

😺 I Consider myself keen on team work, I enjoy dialoguing about the best coding practices because different opinions contribute to a healthier coding base.

🏫 I am a level 4 IT technician.
Currently I study Computer Science. My plan is to also study Master's Degree in Networks and Systems or Artificial Intelligence down the road, I'm open to working in the meantime in partial remote or full remote state.
As a high school student I won the software contest organized by ANPRI.

💾 I’ve grown up with computers and their evolution, so I'm in constant updates too.

🚗 I'm also a Car & Motorcycle enthusiast and home mechanic.

💊 When I'm away from home, I often leave my computer processing information voluntarily for Science and Medicine Research.
